## [v0.0.2](https://github.com/soybeanjs/soybean-ui/compare/v0.0.1...v0.0.2) (2025-11-18)

SoybeanUI v0.0.2 is a significant milestone release, marking the initial formation of the component library system. This release introduces a large number of high-quality UI components and establishes a modern technical architecture based on Headless principles.

## 🌟 Core Features

### 🏗️ Headless + UI Layered Architecture

Adopts an advanced **Headless (Logic Layer)** + **UI (Presentation Layer)** separation architecture:

- **@soybeanjs/headless**: Focuses on component state, interaction logic, and accessibility (A11y), containing no styles, providing a solid foundation for building custom design systems.
- **@soybeanjs/ui**: Built on the Headless layer, combined with **UnoCSS** and `tailwind-variants`, providing a set of beautiful, modern, and easily customizable default styles.

### 🛠️ Modern Tech Stack

- **Vue 3**: Deeply leverages the Composition API, offering flexible component reusability.
- **TypeScript**: Written entirely in TypeScript, providing excellent type safety and development experience.
- **UnoCSS / Tailwind**: Utilizes an atomic CSS engine for high-performance style generation.

## 📦 New Components Overview

This version releases over 40+ basic components, covering the vast majority of Web development scenarios:

- **Basic Components**: `Button`, `Icon`, `Layout`, `Link`
- **Form Components**: `Form`, `Input`, `Checkbox`, `RadioGroup`, `Select`, `Switch`, `Textarea`, `NumberInput`
- **Navigation Components**: `Menu`, `DropdownMenu`, `Breadcrumb`, `Pagination`, `Tabs`, `NavigationMenu`
- **Feedback Components**: `Dialog`, `Drawer`, `Alert`, `Toast`, `Popover`, `Tooltip`, `AlertDialog`
- **Data Display**: `Card`, `Avatar`, `Badge`, `Accordion`, `Collapsible`, `List`
- **Others**: `ConfigProvider`, `VisuallyHidden`

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

- **Accessibility First**: Follows WAI-ARIA standards, ensuring good support for keyboard navigation and screen readers.
- **Highly Customizable**: Developers can easily override and extend component styles via the `ui` prop and `tailwind-variants`.
